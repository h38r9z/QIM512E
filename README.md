Assignment   1:   Needs Assessment   Report
Due:   1   December 2024
Purpose: This assignment   is designed to equip students with the skills   to   conduct   a   needs assessment.   In groups, students need to select an educational   context to   conduct   the   needs   assessment. This serves as the fundamental steps towards the rest   of the other   assignments, which will   build   up to the final   project of this course. Therefore, please   make sure that   you   have   discussed and decided the topic thoroughly with your group members.
Learning Objectives: This assignment will be used   to   assess   your   performance   on   CLO1:
Design a multimedia-based   instructional material involving   needs   assessment,   content-,   learner,   and context analyses,   learning outcomes, assessment   instruments and   instructional strategies.
Guidelines:
1.       Select an educational context: Students should   discuss   and   decide   a   specific
educational setting (e.g., a classroom, training   program, or   online   course)   in which   they   wish to conduct a   needs assessment.   It   is crucial to ensure that   the   chosen   context   is feasible for data collection and analysis.
2.       Data Collection: Students   need to design and   imp代 写QIM512E Multimedia-based Instructional Design Assignment 1R

3.       Data Analysis: After collecting data, students will analyze the   information to   identify the   instructional problem/gap/needs. This analysis   should be   evidence-based.
4.       Reporting   Findings:   Students will   prepare a formal report that   includes the following   components:
●          Introduction:   Provide an overview of the instructional setting and   the   purpose   of   the   needs assessment.
●          Data Collection and Analysis:   Describe the   instrument(s) and   procedure of data   collection, and present   the findings.
●          Problem   Identification: Clearly state the identified   instructional problem(s)   and   provide supporting evidence.
●          Recommendations: Offer initial suggestions of a lesson   or   training   module for   addressing the   identified problem   based on the data analysis.
●         Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and write a   clear and   specific
instructional goal statement (one statement only). This   goal should   be   directly related to   the identified   problem.
